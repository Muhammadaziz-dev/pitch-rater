# 🚀 Deck Insight

**Deck Insight** is an open-source AI tool to **analyze, summarize, and score startup pitch decks** automatically.

- 📄 Upload a startup's pitch deck (PDF)
- 🎥 Upload a startup's pitch video (audio/video)
- 📋 Extracts and structures key information
- 🏆 Scores the startup based on a **custom evaluation rubric** (for investors, accelerators, competition judges)
- 🌎 Calculates **market size** estimates from real-time internet data
- 🛠️ Pulls insights from the startup’s GitHub repositories (for developer tools/open-source startups)
- 💬 Includes a **QA chatbot** to ask natural language questions about the startup

Fully extensible and customizable for your workflows.  
Perfect for investors, analysts, startup competitions, accelerators, and ecosystem builders.

## 🛠 Output Preview

> **Note**: This repository contains only the backend implementation. The screenshots below are from a separate frontend integration built using [Lovable](https://lovable.dev), showcasing how the API endpoints can be consumed and displayed in a user interface.

## 🛠 How It Works

1. Upload or provide a link to the startup’s pitch deck (PDF).
2. The system extracts key information and fills a structured profile.
3. Applies a scoring rubric customized to your preferences.
4. Estimates market size from online data sources.
5. (Optional) If it's a developer tool, pulls additional GitHub repo data.
6. Ask the built-in chatbot for any questions about the startup profile.

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hitesh-ag1/deck-insight.git
cd deck-insight
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up the environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Add your API keys to .env

5. Run FastAPI server:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

6. Test the API with sample decks under ```examples``` folder:
```bash
# Use any deck from the examples/ directory to test
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/analyze-complete" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"file_path": "examples/MapMe-Pitch-Deck.pdf"}'

# Or use the Swagger UI at http://localhost:8000/docs to test interactively
```

## 🏗️ How It’s Built

**Startup Deck Copilot** is architected using modular AI agents orchestrated with the [LangGraph](https://langgraph.readthedocs.io/) framework, all packaged behind a FastAPI server for easy deployment and API access.

### ✨ Core Components

- **Pitch Deck Scorer**  
  - Inputs images of pitch deck slides
  - Uses **Gemini 2.0 Flash** for OCR and visual understanding
  - Generates a structured summary of key startup information (problem, solution, traction, market, business model, team, funding) using **GPT-4o-mini**
  - Scores the startup against a predefined, customizable rubric

- **Market Research Agent**  
  - Uses Tavily Search to research sector, market size, and competitor landscape
  - Summarizes search results using **GPT-4o-mini**

- **GitHub Viewer Agent**  
  - Uses Firecrawl to scrape the startup’s GitHub repositories
  - Summarizes repository activity, health, and community engagement

- **QA Chatbot**  
  - Built as a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system
  - Indexes startup profiles into Elasticsearch
  - On query, retrieves most relevant context and answers using **GPT-4o-mini**

- **Supervisor Agent**  
  - Orchestrates the full analysis pipeline:
    1. **Pitch Deck Scorer**
    2. **Market Research Agent**
    3. **GitHub Viewer Agent** (conditional)

## 🖥️ Frontend Usage (API-Only)

This repository ships a backend API only. You can build any UI (web, mobile, or internal tool) that uploads files and renders JSON responses.

### Capabilities you can expose in a frontend
- Upload a PDF pitch deck and get structured summaries + scoring.
- Upload a pitch video/audio and get an investor-style critique, hard questions, and a readiness score.
- Run market size research given a company overview JSON.
- Analyze a GitHub repo URL for developer-tool startups.
- Ask Q&A questions against the analyzed pitch deck context.

### Base URL
When running locally:
```
http://localhost:8000
```

### Suggested UI flow
1. Upload a pitch deck (PDF) or a pitch video/audio file.
2. Show the returned summary + scorecard + weak points.
3. Let users drill into investor questions and skepticism flags.
4. Provide a Q&A box powered by `/chat-assistant`.

### Frontend integration examples
Use multipart uploads for files:
```bash
# Pitch deck (PDF)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/analyze-pitch-deck" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "file=@/path/to/deck.pdf"

# Pitch video (video/audio)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/analyze-video-pitch" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "file=@/path/to/pitch.mp4"
```

Use JSON for text inputs:
```bash
# Market size analysis
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/analyze-market-size" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"company_name":"Acme","business_description":"..."}'

# Chat assistant
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/chat-assistant" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message":"What is the problem statement?","thread_id":null}'
```
